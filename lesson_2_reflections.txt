What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
to start the git. i.e. to start tracking commits. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working Directory: Main Folder
Staging area: Temp, before you commit
Repository: Commits

git diff [working and staged]
git diff --staged [staged and commited]
git reset --hard [ignore all changes]

git checkout master [goto head]

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
1. adding files relavent to that logical commit step to the staging area

git branch <branchname>
git checkout <branchname>

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
1. Expermental features
2. Testing new ideas

git log --graph --oneline <> <>

git show <commitid> [diff ... after merge .. interleaved commit-ids]
