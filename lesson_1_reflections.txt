How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it helps in tracking which line number was changes and what was the change.

Having different version helps in traching changes. Otherwise on has to consiously keep different copies of the same file whenever a change is made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: Logical checkpoints
working version
Cons:
missing/fogetting to save version 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
mot for coding
no logical relation between files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
